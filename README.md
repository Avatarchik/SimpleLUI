# SimpleLUI

Simple Lua User Interface is what is says. It gives you ability to create user interface via LUA scripts. Main SLUI feature is a UnityEditor extension that lets you convert selected Canvas in to .lua script, and thanks to automatic scripts reload, your changes will be always immiedetly reloaded in to the game runtime! 

Is SimpleLUI for you?
 - If you are looking to create some kind of sandbox environment in unity and you want the user to get access to UI... then Yes! SimpleLUI is only but a nice alternative for solutions like WebUI (with is better in general than SLUI, but goal of SLUI is to only give that second option).
